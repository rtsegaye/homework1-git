What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer 
    -> "git merge" is used as a way to combine two different brance that has been in progress. 
        This is benefical because it will allow developers to take a project split their work, 
        work separatly and merge their changes at the end. 

    -> On the same note, "git rebase" is, also, used as a way to merge two different branches 
        that has been in progress separatly. However, the difference from "git merge" is that
        rebasing essentially takes commits, duplicates them and put them together somewhere else.
        Therefore, "git rebase" makes more cleaner merge of two branches.
